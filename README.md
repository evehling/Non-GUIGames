# Non GUI Games
This is a collection of games that were assigned as a part of my Python course last semester--these were super fun to make and play, and it's cool to see my progression towards learning and implementing OOP as the semester went on. The files are organized by assignment number, as some require multiple files to run properly. 

# Warning
Program concepts are credited entirely to the USC ITP department. You are welcome to play, download and modify these files as you like! However, all of these files have been uploaded to a grading database and MAY NOT be copied or modified for the purpose of submitting them as course assignments--THEY WILL BE FLAGGED AS PLAGIARIZED CONTENT EVEN IF THEY ARE ALTERED!
